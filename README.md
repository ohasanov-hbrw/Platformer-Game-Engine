# Platformer-Game-Engine
haha yes mistakes go brrrr

This small project of mine is just a "learning project" of some sort. If you inspect the code youll see that te levels are hard coded and such... I am going to fix all of that, the goal is to make a puzzle platformer. If you have any ideas/problems be sure to write it in the Issues part.

Special thanks to MasterFeizz for porting "Raylib" and special thanks to Raysan5 for making "Raylib". And also thanks to GlazedBelmont for teaching me how to use github :p

Thx for checking it out!
